Hello! The name's Afiq Ilyasa Akmal. I am a student at the Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia and currently residing in Depok, Indonesia to finish my undergraduate study (sometimes i also go back to my house in Bekasi!)

In addition to my internship as a product manager, I am currently focusing my interest in machine learning by taking courses such as computer vision, natural language processing, information retrieval, and social media analytics. I am open to the possibility of future internships in this field :)

You can see my portfolio [here](#), my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/afiqilyasaakmal/), and my blogs [here](https://afiqilyasakmal.github.io/blog/). When it comes to writing, I will mix it up, using English or Bahasa Indonesia.

Let's keep in touch! Drop me a message at afiq.ilyasa [at] ui [dot] ac [dot] id. See ya!
